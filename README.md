# Choropleth with Shiny
### *Choropleth in Shiny with some advanced features*


I made this to play around with Shiny shiny and ultimately create something with slightly more complexity than most simple plots.

The dataset was generated by in 2017 by me for [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-017-9984-1). Mostly the data comes from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 

Features
* Spatial functions to map hover coordinates to states.
  + Allows for the output of any data in the dataset when a state is hovered over. 
* Slider control changes year and can be "played" for an animated view.
* Radio buttons to select variable to map in the choropleth. 
  + I have included two different inequality measures, but any variable in the dataset could be added.
